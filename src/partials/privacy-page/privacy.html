            <h3 class="privacy-subtitle">Do Not Track</h3>
            <p class="privacy-text">Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option
            that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the
            user's browser DNT preference setting.
            
            Bruden Mode does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in
            part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or
            regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Bruden Mode takes privacy and meaningful
            choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
            implementation of a standard.</p>
